### Target Enumeration, Reconnaissance, and Methodology Suggester 

TERMS aims to take the pain out of learning enumeration. It dynamically identifies ports, instructs how to perform basic nmap scans and holds your hand through your initial enumeration by providing resources related to the ports that were discovered. Discovered ports will be highlighted, commands used will be written to a file to be reviewed later, and all the information presented will be accessible locally in a structured folder for future reference. 

Instructions will have been provided if you are a designated tester.

### Installation and Usage

Installing and using TERMS is easy! Just use git to clone the repository, install the dependancies and off you go.

```
git clone https://github.com/0xskunk/terms.git
```

```
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
```

```
pip3 install art colorama
```
